4.Write a program that uses nested loops to print a pattern of asterisks in the shape of
    a right-angled triangle. Allow the user to specify the number of rows in the triangle.

5.Write a program to find the sum of each even number, given range of values. User
    will determine the range of value by entering the starting value and ending value.

6.Create a program that takes a user's input string and performs following string operations.
    The program should ask the user to input a string, then let user select an operation to
    manipulate the string and display the outcome at the end of program.
    String operation:
            a. Capitalize the string
            b. Reverse the string
            c. Display the length of the string
            d. Find a specific word in a string
            e. Replace a specific word with a new word
            f. Extend the string
