1.Create a program that takes an integer as input from the user. Depending
    on whether the number is positive, negative, or zero, display an
    appropriate message.

2.Write a program to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not.
    A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it’s
    also divisible by 400.

3.Write a program that takes a student’s score as input and assigns a letter
    grade based on the following grading scale:
    A: 85-100
    B: 65-84
    C: 50-64
    F: Below 50

4.Write a program that asks the user for a temperature in degrees Celsius.Convert
    this temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula: Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32.
    Then, display the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. Use `if-else`
    statement to print a message indicating whether the temperature is “HOT” (above 30°C),
    “MODERATE” (between 20°C and 30°C), or “COOL” (below 20°C).

5.Build a program asks the user for two numbers and an operation (addition, subtraction,
    multiplication, or division). Perform the selected operation on the numbers and display
    the result. Ensure that division by zero is handled gracefully by checking if the second
    number is zero before performing the division.

6.Create a program that takes a user's input string and performs following string operations.
    The program should ask the user to input a string, then let user select an operation to
    manipulate the string and display the outcome at the end of program.
    String operation:
            a. Capitalize the string
            b. Reverse the string
            c. Display the length of the string
            d. Find a specific word in a string
            e. Replace a specific word with a new word
            f. Extend the string
